#### CodeX is a AI based web application which uses advanced GPT 3 model API to communicate with the user.The user can ask the AI for help regarding any programming language like C, C++, Java, JavaScript etc ,giving it code and translating it to another programming language, and much more.

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. For the backend I have used Node, Express and OpenAI APIs.
